# Project Name

**Author**: Joanna Coll and Matt Harding
**Version**: 1.1.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This is a blog with articles that can be seen as previews and then expended on to view the full articles. The user can also select articles by author or category. The goal is to make the functionality user-friendly and allow the user to find their desired article faster without needing to scroll through all the content.

## Getting Started
1. Link the article view into html.
2. Put the data attributes into article.js to link them with our article viewer.
3. Refactored the option function concatenation using template literals.
4. Create filter handler functions for both author and category.
5. Create the nav handler function to show content for the tabs.
6. Create the functionality to expend the articles beyond the preview.
7. Call all the functions at document ready and hide the article template.

## Architecture
HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery
